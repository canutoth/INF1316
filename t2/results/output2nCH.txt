[GMV] Allocating page 0 from P3 in frame 13
[GMV] Substituting [P3] p9 by [P3] p0 in frame 13
[GMV] received from P4: page = 20, type of acess = W
[GMV] PAGE FAULT in process 4, page 20
[GMV] Writing dirty page 2 (P2) to swap
[GMV] Allocating page 20 from P4 in frame 15
[GMV] Substituting [P2] p2 by [P4] p20 in frame 15
